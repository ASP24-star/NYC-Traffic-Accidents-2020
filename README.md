NYC-Traffic-Accidents-2020

Data Analysis and Visulaization on NYC Traffic Accidents From January through August 2020

About the Dataset: Accidents involving vehicles that the New York City Police Department has recorded between January and August 2020. Each record details a specific collision, including the occasion, date, and place of the incident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), as well as the participating vehicles and victims, as well as any contributing circumstances. 

Analysis: 
1. In terms of accidents, January and February have seen the most occurrences. For the following two months, the rate decreased. But from May through July, the accident rate rose, and then it started to slightly decline in August. This can be seen

2. And do you know which day of the week has seen the most accidents in 2020? It's "FRIDAY." And guess what—SUNDAY—is the day with the fewest accidents. It seems contradictory because Sundays are typically when people go out, therefore it makes sense that "SUNDAY" would be the day with the most accidents, but it is what it is.

3. With 3,089 incidents in Brooklyn in January and 2,918 accidents in Queens in the same month, "BROOKLYN" and "QUEENS" were the boroughs with the most accidents. However, "STATEN ISLAND" is the borough that experienced the fewest accidents in 2020. (Jan-Aug).

4. Well, the most crucial aspect of accidents is to determine what led to them, what was the reason, or more generally, what was a contributing component. Driver inattention/distraction, which resulted in over 20,000 accidents, is the key contributing element in NYC 2020. "Driving too closely to the automobile in front" came in second place and was responsible for more than 5,000 accidents.
